## Visual Studio Code
[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (VSC) was used as to create and develeop Local Heroes. VSC is an lightning fast FREE open-source editor designed by [Microsoft](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/) with developers in mind. Visual Studio code allows developers to easily apply the edit-build-debug cycle, resulting in more productivity on your ideas.

[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) brings all that you need as a developer, such as: debugging, instant editing results, customization specifically designed for your preference, hundreds of languages, extensions, version control, and more all at your fingertips!
## Node.js

Node.js was used in combination with VSC. Node.js allows the user to interact with the command line interface instead of the window object. You can download Node [here](https://nodejs.org/en/).

## MySQL
Local Heroes database was tested/seeded using the structured querying language [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com). MySQL is an open-source relational database system that helps organize data into one or more tables and establish relationships between them. 

## npm and Express

[npm](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer) was used in combination with [Express](https://expressjs.com/) to create a backend middleware server. Express is a flexible Node.js application frameworke that provides many features available for both mobile and the web. Please click the referenced information for documentation on npm and Express.

## GitHub/Git

In order to make effective changes to the website both [Git](https://gitforwindows.org/) and [GitHub](https://github.com/) were used in synchronization to push commits of the latest updated version.

Git is version control system which allows multiple users to make changes to one single repository.

GitHub is a corporation which provides hosting for version control using Git and software development. [GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/setting-up-and-managing-your-github-user-account/managing-user-account-settings) provides all needs for setting up your GitHub and answering problem-solving issues you may come across while using GitHub.
